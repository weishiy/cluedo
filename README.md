# SWEN225-Assignment-1

This project is based on SWEN225 Assignment 1, which involved creating a Cluedo game.

It involves creating a prototype of the game "Hobby Detectives," inspired by the popular board game Cluedo. The objective is to develop a social deduction detective game for 2-4 players, played on a 24x24 board with estates and non-interactable spots. Players are assigned characters randomly, and one character, weapon, and estate combination is secretly chosen as the game's solution. Players move around the board by rolling dice and make guesses or solve attempts to deduce the correct combination. The game includes text-based input and output for all interactions. The project's solution will also serve as the foundation for a subsequent assignment.
